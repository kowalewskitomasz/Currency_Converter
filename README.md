# Currency Converter
Free time project - Application which was build mostly for learning purposes. 
## Introduction and general description:
I built this application to improve myself in designing desktop applications using Java and JavaFX and to learn how to use and parse data gathered from external API (in this case I worked with [NBP Web API](http://api.nbp.pl/)). In this project I used some additional tools: JAXB (to unmarshal XML to Java classes) and Jersey (to handle requests to API). All exchange rates present in application update daily based on information provided by NBP Web API. Small writing at the bottom of application in all views except main menu shows when was the last update.
## Main functionalities:
#### 1. Currency calculator together with chart presenting how exchange rate for chosen currencies changed over selected period of time
